# Insecure Auto VPN
An experiment in automating a TTY to connect to an OpenVPN server.

> Commands need to be run as `root` because `openvpn` itself needs to run as `root`.

# Install

```bash
sudo npm i -g insecure-auto-vpn;
```

# Create Configuration File

```bash
sudo iavpn -g
```

# Usage

```bash
sudo iavpn
```
